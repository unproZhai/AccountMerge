# AccountMerge
## Project setup
```
mvn clean install
```

## Compile and run
```
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=AccountMerge
```

#### Please note that in the instruction file, the application number of an account is set as a String, but in the actuall sample text file, it's passed as a Long. So I set the type as Long.
